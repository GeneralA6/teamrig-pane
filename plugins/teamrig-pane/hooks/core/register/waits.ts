/**
 * What a waiting task waits for, each a typed reason, and when a reason clears:
 * - `decision` and `approval` name who must give it: the lead's id or the owner's marker (a peer's work is a
 *   task to wait on, see {@link isPeerWait}). Only the task's owner knows when it came, so they clear when the
 *   owner sets a new status;
 * - `task` names a task that must finish first. Only a task already started can wait on one: a task that
 *   needs another before it starts stays open with a plan dependency (`after`) instead. It is ready once that
 *   task is done or dropped;
 * - `time` is a stored minute in UTC (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`) or a bare day of the team's zone, meaning its end there. It is
 *   ready once that time passed.
 * A task stays waiting until its owner sets a new status, which clears every reason; `check` flags a waiting
 * task whose reasons are all ready.
