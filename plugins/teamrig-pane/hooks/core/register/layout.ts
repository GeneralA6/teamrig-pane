/**
 * The register's files in its state folder, and how a reader puts them together. Pure: the reader
 * hands in the texts (or a `LayoutFiles` that reads them), so a viewer reads them exactly as teamrig does.
 * - `events.jsonl`, the tail, where every write appends. A register never rotated holds its whole
 *   history there and nothing else, as before rotation existed.
 * - `archive/events-000001.jsonl` and on, the segments. A rotation turns the tail into the next segment
 *   whole and starts a new tail whose first line names it (marker.ts). A segment is never rewritten or
 *   deleted: the archive and the tail hold every line ever written, in order.
 * - `snapshot.jsonl`, the working set as of a segment: a header, then, in write order, every event but
 *   those of the tasks a compaction retired (finished long ago), each the line as written. A task's state depends on its own events
 *   only, so these fold to exactly the tasks it kept; retired tasks stay in the segments.
 * A working-set read folds the snapshot, the segments it does not cover and the tail, so its cost follows
 * the recent events. A history read folds every segment and the tail.
