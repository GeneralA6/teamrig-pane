/**
 * The done groups (T1729, T1121): one rule that sorts a span's done work into the groups the
 * owner reads it in, so the daily report, the meeting agenda's DONE section and the pane's Done page never disagree.
 * A task done in the span goes in the first group it fits: Owner asked (its source is the owner marker), one group per
 * goal (its first goal), Urgent p1 (priority p0 or p1), This week's plan (its planning week holds the moment it was
 * done) and Other work. Dropped tasks are counted apart, never mixed in. Pure: no clock, no disk, no `node:` imports
 * (the pane vendors it through `read/index`). It reads only the fields of DoneGroupTask and hands back the caller's own
 * rows, so the pane groups its task rows, which lack most of Task's fields, without copying them into Tasks.
