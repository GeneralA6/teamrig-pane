/**
 * The register's event format. Version 0 lines have no `v`; version 1 adds `"v": 1` and nothing
 * else; version 2 names the task field `priority` where older lines wrote `tier`. All three parse
 * the same way: an old line's `tier` reads as its priority and the line is never rewritten.
 * Version 2 later gained, without a new number, a task's `after` list and the `waiting` status with its
 * `waits`, which replaced `blocked`: an older reader ignores the new fields and skips a `waiting` line as
 * a newer teamrig's, and a `blocked` line reads here as `waiting` with no reasons. It also gained a
 * `verifying` status's `proof`, a task's `description` (0.44.0) and its `size` (0.47.0), and a `waiting` status's
 * decision `card` (0.79.0), the same `waits` and `card` on a `verifying` line for what its proof waits for
 * (0.109.0), an update's approval `verdict` (0.126.0), a task's `kind` (0.147.0), its `pin` (T637), a status line's
 * `review` (T916), a task's `type` and `critical` mark (T1252), which replaced `kind`, and a `done` status's `watch`
 * (T1306), an update's `waits` (T1295), a task's `noGoal` mark (T1730), an update's `decided` mark (T1366) and its
 * `sizeBase` (T649), which an older reader ignores:
 * each reads there as none (an answered update as a note alone). An older teamrig re-serialized the events of the snapshot a rotation or
 * `compact` rewrites, so it dropped such a field there (the archive keeps the lines as written); this one copies
 * each kept line as written (compaction.ts).
 * Version 3 adds the `moved` record (T1144), and only a moved line carries it: an older teamrig reads that line as a
 * newer format and writes to the register no more, so no session of it changes a task that moved to another team.
 * Parsing checks the FORMAT only (any priority from 0, any goal string): team policy is applied
 * on write, so changing the config never erases history.
