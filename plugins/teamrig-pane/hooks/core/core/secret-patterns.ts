/**
 * Secrets written as text rather than as a token: credentials inside a URL or an Authorization header and
 * `password=`-style assignments. Shared-file writes and redaction use them all; the write-time set and the scrub leave
 * out the broad `secret-assignment` for the stricter `ASSIGNED_SECRET`, as documentation shows placeholders such as
 * `password: ${VAULT}`.
 * An assignment's key word may end a longer name, as env vars and code write it (`DB_PASSWORD`, `clientSecret`):
 * no word boundary comes before it, since an underscore is a word character. A quoted key, as JSON and YAML write
 * it (`"password": `), counts too.
 * An assignment's key never ends a name with a `/` in it (a branch such as `feat/jwt-previous-secret`, a path):
 * a note naming one ahead of a colon names it, it does not assign it. A dotted key (`jwt.secret`), a header
 * (`X-Api-Key`) and a URL's query still count. That check follows the key word, so it runs only where one matched,
 * not at every place in a long run of word characters.
 * An Authorization header's credential is opaque, so its scheme word frames it: a placeholder in its place
 * (`$TOKEN`, `${TOKEN}`, `<token>`, `%TOKEN%`) or a word under 8 characters is not one.
 * A URL's password is the secret, except GitHub's fixed `x-oauth-basic`: there the login is the token.
