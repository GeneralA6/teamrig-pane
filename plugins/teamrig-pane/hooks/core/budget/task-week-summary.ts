/**
 * What each task has cost, kept by the budget hooks (src/budget/task-week-file.ts) for a reader that ranks tasks
 * without metering them, as the pane's lists do: a task with no size is scored on its spend, and turning W into percent
 * takes the account's meter log, which no reader through src/read has. One file per team, beside its week summary
 * (src/budget/team-week-summary.ts), at `TASKS_WEEK_IN_STATE` under the team's state folder (`<kit
 * home>/teams/<team>/state`, unless the team config's `paths.state` moves it); the format, one JSON object:
 *
 * - `v`: `TASKS_WEEK_FORMAT`;
 * - `at`: when it was read, epoch ms, to the minute;
 * - `spentPct`: each task the team's sessions spent W on, by its id, in id order: the W the meter keeps on it, the use
 *   outside the team's sessions included, at the team's own W per percent. A task with a size base counts only from
 *   that base (src/budget/task-use.ts `spentSince`), as the ranking does, so a reader scores it as `teamrig list` does.
 *   A task with no spend, or a sized one with none since its base, has no entry.
 * - `likeMedians`: the median spend of each kind of task done inside the like window, `{ workClass, type, pct }` by
 *   class and then type, an unset type (null) first, as `teamrig list` sizes an unsized task by them
 *   (src/register/ranking.ts `likeMedians`): each task's whole cost, its size base aside, at the same rate. A reader
 *   sizes by them (`storedSizing`) and never works them out again, as its own hold of the meter keeps fewer days.
 *
 * A hook of any of the team's sessions rewrites the file when that changes it. Format 1 had no `likeMedians` and reads
 * as no file, unlike most stores' older formats: a reader sizing without the medians would rank unsized tasks apart
 * from `teamrig list`, and the next turn's hook writes format 2 over it (src/budget/summary-file.ts `keepSummaryFile`).
