/**
 * The team's week summary: its used and planned part of the account's week, kept by the budget hooks
 * (src/budget/team-week-file.ts) for a reader that shows each team's week without recomputing the budget, as the
 * pane's Teams tab does. One file per team, in its own folder: a child team keeps its own, and a reader that shows a
 * parent with its children adds theirs to it. It sits at `TEAM_WEEK_IN_STATE` under the team's state folder
 * (`<kit home>/teams/<team>/state`, unless the team config's `paths.state` moves it); the format, one JSON object:
 *
 * - `v`: `TEAM_WEEK_FORMAT`;
 * - `account`: the Claude account whose week the percents are of, as teamrig tells accounts apart (src/budget/account.ts
 *   `accountsOf`): the `budget.account` the team names, else the config dir its sessions run in. A reader adds up only
 *   files that name one account: teams on two accounts each have a week of their own;
 * - `usedPct`: the team's use since the week began, in percent of the account's week: its sessions' W at the team's
 *   own W per percent (the use outside every team is no team's);
 * - `plannedPct`: the team's use by the week's end as planned: `usedPct` plus its part (src/budget/parts.ts
 *   `teamShareOf`) of what the account has left to `budget.targetPct`;
 * - `accountUsedPct`: the account's use of the week, in percent: every team's and the use outside them;
 * - `resetsAt`: the week's reset, epoch ms;
 * - `at`: when it was read, epoch ms, to the minute;
 * - `limits`: the stretches the account's week sat at its usage limit, oldest first, each `{ start, end }` in epoch ms
 *   (src/budget/extra.ts `limitSpansOf`), for a reader that marks those days but cannot load the meter log, as the
 *   pane's Stats tab. Every team on the account writes the same list, at most one stretch a period the log still keeps.
 *
 * Percents are rounded to two decimals. A hook of any of the team's sessions rewrites it when that changes it. Format 1
 * had every field but `account` and `limits`; it is still read, naming no account and no stretch, since a team whose
 * sessions are idle keeps its file until a hook of it runs again.
