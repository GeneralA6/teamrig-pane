/**
 * Each session's week: its use of the account's week so far and its hours with work, kept by the budget hooks
 * (src/budget/session-week-file.ts) for a reader that shows each session's week without metering it, as the pane's
 * Teams card does. One file per team, beside its week summary (src/budget/team-week-summary.ts), at
 * `SESSIONS_WEEK_PATH` under the team's home (`<kit home>/teams/<team>`); the format, one JSON object:
 *
 * - `v`: `SESSIONS_WEEK_FORMAT`;
 * - `resetsAt`: the week's reset, epoch ms;
 * - `at`: when it was read, epoch ms, to the minute;
 * - `sessions`: each session on the team's roster, by its id:
 *   - `usedPct`: its use since the week began, in percent of the account's week, the unit the status line counts in:
 *     its W at the team's own W per percent;
 *   - `workHours`: the UTC hours since the week began in which it used any W, the week's first hour counted whole.
 *
 * Percents are rounded to two decimals. A hook of any of the team's sessions rewrites it when that changes it.
