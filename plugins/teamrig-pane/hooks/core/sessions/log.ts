 * `teamrig open` started it again, resumed in its last Claude Code session or fresh. A session whose newest
 * record is a close is closed by teamrig. A newer format is skipped on read and refuses a write.
 * A close's `folder` (T1408) is no new format, as the register's optional fields are none (src/register/events.ts):
 * no teamrig rewrites this log, and an older one ignores it and reopens the session in the project, fresh when its
 * transcript is not there. A new format would instead fail an older tab's close after its tab ended, unlogged.
 * A home close (no `claudeSession`, T1364) is no new format either: an older teamrig skips it as damaged and sees its
 * session as never closed, so only its idle pass leaves it home.
