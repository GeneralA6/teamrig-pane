 * Claude Code's permission allow rules (`Tool` or `Tool(body)`), as `teamrig permissions trim` and the flags read
 * them. An allow rule approves a call before auto mode's classifier sees it, so a rule that approves a whole tool or a
 * program with any arguments (a bare tool name, or a `*` in the body) skips the one check that stops an injected or
 * mistaken action. Claude Code saves an approved command whole, so a rule can hold a credential (a URI with a password,
 * a token) that stays in the settings file; it is counted as its own class and goes too. A team keeps the rules on its
 * `permissions.keepAllow` list. Since a rule's text can hold such a value, a rule off that list is only ever counted by
 * its class, never shown.
