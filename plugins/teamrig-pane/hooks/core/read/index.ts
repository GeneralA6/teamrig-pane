/**
 * The read side of teamrig's files, for readers that cannot run teamrig itself (a status pane, a
 * dashboard): the same parse, fold and counts every teamrig command uses, with nothing that touches
 * the disk, the clock or `node:` modules. A reader hands in the text it read and gets back what
 * teamrig would show. It only re-exports: the logic lives beside the commands that use it, so the
 * two can never drift. `read/index.test.ts` fails if anything reachable from here imports `node:`.
